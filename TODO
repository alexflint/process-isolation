# DONE
# - Implement docstring copying
# - Add the module to local sys.modules so that it doesn't get loaded by some other module
# - Migrate objects between client and server with "byvalue"
# - Avoid reloading modules on server side
# - Multiple separately isolated processes
# - Deal with generators
# - Deal with files
# - Deal with lambdas

# TODO - before first release
# - documentation
# - make a nice "insubprocess" function decorator
# - test on: 
			[done] sys
			[done] os
			marshal
			sqlite
			thread
			numpy
			runpy
			flask (isolate the client funcs)
# - Add an API to restart the server if it goes down
# - If a module already exists when it is imported isolated then replace it

# TODO - before 1.0
# - trim the exposed interface using an __init__.py file
# - Transport stack trace from server to client and append it to the system one at the client end
# - Make it possible to automatically restart the server?
# - When a proxy's __del__ gets called, change the server-side registry reference to a weakref so that
#   objects eventually get cleaned up
# - Deal with call to sys.exit() in child process
# - Detect when cPickle fails to pickle an object and automatically proxy it instead


# TODO - before 2.0
# - Have the client 
# - In Client.call, check that all RemoteRefs live in the remote host matching the current client
# - Switch to the lower-level multiprocessing.Pipe in order to get access to the pickler object
# - Omit __len__, __call__, __dir__, etc whenever the prime doesn't offer them
# - Implement reload(mymodule)
# - Replace __getattr__ with dynamically inserted descriptors
# - Can all exceptions classes in 'exceptions' be safely copied?
# - Implement syntax like:
#     with process_isolation.Timeout(200):
#       foo.bar()
# - Make it possible to host objects on the client and send proxies to them to the server
# - Deal with multi-threaded clients and servers


# TODO - less important
# - Figure out how to get rid of RemoteRef -- too confusing!
# - Deal with modifications to global state
# - Deal with extra-special funtions like __getattribute__, __class__, etc



# Reasons to re-implement pickle:
# - support auto-wrapping of nested objects
# - support lazily constructing proxies on client side and caching them
# - support transporting code and types directly
# - could dynamically create classes on server side and transport them to client side
# - pickle can't transport tracebacks
# - pickle does not support __getstate__, __setstate__, etc on __getnewargs__ on types (i.e. metaclass instances)
# - When pickling exceptions, cPickle doesn't follow the pickle protocol at all
#   - in particular, the exception constructor must accept zero args
# - When we serialize proxies internally, we want to copy just the
#   remote_id and other metadata, but when the end-user pickles a
#   proxy object, we want someproxy.__getstate__ to delegate to the
#   server-side implementation. We can't cleanly meet both
#   requirements if we use pickle for transporting proxies between
#   client and server.
